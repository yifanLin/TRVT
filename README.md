Time-series RNA-seq Visualization Toolkit source codes

1. extract zip and check requirement.txt to ensure your system meets them (I also include installation cmd in case you need them)
2. run app.py in your terminal and follow the prompt to open http://127.0.0.1:8050/
3. follow guides in the above interface to visualize time-series RNA-seq data with custom cutoffs and timepoints
4. note: in this page, RNA-seq data is processed by DESeq2. And this prototype hasn't been enabled to process other datasets yet, which is my next step.
